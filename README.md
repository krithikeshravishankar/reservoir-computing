# Reservoir Computing and Control of Chaotic Systems

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and figures for experiments in reservoir computing, control of chaotic systems (primarily the Lorenz system), and related data-driven methods. The codebase includes simulations, control experiments, metric analyses, and visualizations for various dynamical systems.
